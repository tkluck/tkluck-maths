    "We will use the `MatrixFactorizations` package and the Julia language to compute a few compositions in the bicategory of Landau-Ginzburg models. As a concrete example, we take the matrix $Q$ from [Carqueville-Runkel][1] Thm. 7.6 that provides an orbifold equivalence between $A_{2d-1}$ and $D_{d+1}$. We compute a finite-rank representation of $Q \\otimes Q^\\vee$.\n",
